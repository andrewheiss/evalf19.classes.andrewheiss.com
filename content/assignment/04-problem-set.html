<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>This problem set is more theoretical and abstract than previous assignments. You’ll practice figuring out ways of meausring outcomes and drawing causal diagrams.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to type all your text in RStudio (understandable, since there’s not a nice spell checker), you can type everything in Word and then copy/paste it into your R Markdown document.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open the project named “Problem Set 4” on RStudio.cloud. <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/26160/project/560432">This link should take you to the project</a>—if it doesn’t, log in and look for the project named “Problem Set 4.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively (and preferably now), if you’re using R on your own computer, download this file, <em>unzip it</em>, and double click on the file named <code>problem-set-4.Rproj</code>: <a href="/files/problem-set-4.zip"><i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> <code>problem-set-4.zip</code></a>. You’ll need to make sure you have these packages installed on your computer: <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>ggdag</code>. If you try to load one of those packages with <code>library(tidyverse)</code> or <code>library(ggdag)</code>, etc., and R gives an error that the package is missing, use the “Packages” panel in RStudio to install it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Rename the R Markdown file named <code>your-name_problem-set-4.Rmd</code> to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the tasks given in the R Markdown file. If you see text in ALL CAPS you <em>don’t</em> need to put your answers in all caps.</p></li>
<li><p>When you’re all done, click on the “Knit” button at the top of the editing window and create a PDF or Word document of your problem set. Upload that file to iCollege.</p></li>
</ol>
