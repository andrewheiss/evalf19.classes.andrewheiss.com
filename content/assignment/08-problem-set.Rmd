# Instructions

1. If you're using R on your own computer ([follow these instructions if you haven't already](/install/)), download this file, *unzip it*, and double click on the file named `problem-set-8.Rproj`: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `problem-set-8.zip`](/files/problem-set-8.zip). You'll need to make sure you have the `tidyverse`, `rdrobust`, `rddensity`, and `huxtable` packages installed on your computer. If you try to load them with `library(tidyverse)`, etc. and R gives an error that the package is missing, use the "Packages" panel in RStudio to install it.
    - Alternatively, open the project named "Problem Set 8" on RStudio.cloud. [This link should take you to the project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/26160/project/677953)â€”if it doesn't, log in and look for the project named "Problem Set 8."

2. Rename the R Markdown file named `your-name_problem-set-8.Rmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio.

3. Complete the tasks given in the R Markdown file.

4. When you're all done, click on the "Knit" button at the top of the editing window and create a PDF or Word document of your problem set. Upload that file to iCollege.

```{r knit-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/assignment/knit-button.png")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(wakefield)
library(scales)

# Make fake data
set.seed(1234)
program <- r_data_frame(
  n = 1200,
  id,
  attendance = rbeta(shape1 = 7, shape2 = 2)
) %>% 
  mutate(attendance = rescale(attendance, to = c(20, 100))) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = attendance < 80) %>% 
  mutate(grade = (200 * treatment) + (20 * attendance) + rnorm(n(), 600, 100)) %>% 
  mutate(grade = rescale(grade, to = c(0, 100))) %>% 
  mutate(grade = ifelse(grade < 80, grade * (attendance / rnorm(n(), 80, 3)), grade)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(attendance, grade), list(~ round(., 2)))

ggplot(program, aes(x = attendance, y = grade)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(program, attendance < 80))

write_csv(program, "~/Desktop/attendance_program.csv")
```
