# Instructions

1. Open the project named "Problem Set 5" on RStudio.cloud. [This link should take you to the project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/26160/project/581468)—if it doesn't, log in and look for the project named "Problem Set 5."
    - Alternatively (and preferably now), if you're using R on your own computer, download this file, *unzip it*, and double click on the file named `problem-set-5.Rproj`: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `problem-set-5.zip`](/files/problem-set-5.zip). You'll need to make sure you have these packages installed on your computer: `tidyverse`, `ggdag`. If you try to load one of those packages with `library(tidyverse)` or `library(ggdag)`, etc., and R gives an error that the package is missing, use the "Packages" panel in RStudio to install it.

2. Rename the R Markdown file named `your-name_problem-set-5.Rmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio.

3. Complete the tasks given in the R Markdown file.

4. When you're all done, click on the "Knit" button at the top of the editing window and create a PDF or Word document of your problem set. Upload that file to iCollege.
