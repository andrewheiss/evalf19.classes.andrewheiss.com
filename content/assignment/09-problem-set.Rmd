# Instructions

1. If you're using R on your own computer ([follow these instructions if you haven't already](/install/)), download this file, *unzip it*, and double click on the file named `problem-set-9.Rproj`: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `problem-set-9.zip`](/files/problem-set-9.zip). You'll need to make sure you have the `tidyverse`, `huxtable`, and `estimatr` packages installed on your computer. If you try to load them with `library(tidyverse)`, etc. and R gives an error that the package is missing, use the "Packages" panel in RStudio to install it.
    - Alternatively, open the project named "Problem Set 9" on RStudio.cloud. [This link should take you to the project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/26160/project/705520)â€”if it doesn't, log in and look for the project named "Problem Set 9."

2. Rename the R Markdown file named `your-name_problem-set-9.Rmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio.

3. Complete the tasks given in the R Markdown file.

4. When you're all done, click on the "Knit" button at the top of the editing window and create a PDF or Word document of your problem set. Upload that file to iCollege.
