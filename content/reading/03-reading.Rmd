# Additional pre-class assignment

Choose a social program that you're interested in. Draw a logic model or results chain that is as detailed as you can get it, including all the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes you can think of. This doesn't have to be perfectâ€”we'll talk about it and critique and improve it in class.

You can do this by hand or with something like [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/home), or [Creately](https://creately.com/).
