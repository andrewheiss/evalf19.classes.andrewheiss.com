# The r_data_frame() function lets you generate random data. You just have to
# feed it the name of a function that generates variables. You can see all the
# possible variable-generating functions by running variables() in the R
# console:
variables()

# Here we generate a small data frame. Each of the functions that are listed in variables() has arguments. See age, for instance---we can specify a range of ages to draw from
small_data <- r_data_frame(
  n = 30,
  age(5:18),  # Young kids
  income(digits = 5),  # Rich kids
  zip_code,
  race,
  gender_inclusive
)

# Look at the first few rows
head(small_data)

# You can make more complicated data too, like adding normally-distributed
# income, or assigning people to treatment and control groups
treatment <- r_data_frame(
  n = 500,
  race,
  age(5:18),
  income = rnorm(mean = 100000, sd = 15000)  # Normal distribution centered at 100000
) %>%

  age(5:18),
  income = rnorm(mean = 50000, sd = 15000)  # Normal distribution centered at 50000
) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = "No")

# We can combine these two datasets into one with bind_rows(), which essentially
# stacks the rows of one on top of the rows of the other:
big_data_set <- bind_rows(treatment, control)

# For fun, we can check the difference in income for people in the treatment and control groups

Whoa! Look at that! The imaginary program boosted incomes substantially! :)

In problem set 5 you worked with fake data about a hypothetical math camp. Here's the code I used to generate that data. The only odd thing here is the `rtruncnorm()` function, which generates data from a truncated normal distribution. This makes it so you can put limits on numbersâ€”if you want a random distribution of GPAs centered at 3.5, you don't want to accidentally create GPAs of 4.3 or whatever. The `a` and `b` arguments let you set a minimum and a maximum number.
